# Features Implemented

## Summary of Changes

This document describes all the new features and fixes implemented for the Gym Management System.

---

## 1. ✅ Fixed Delete Enquiry Functionality

### Problem
Delete operation for enquiries was not working properly due to foreign key constraints.

### Solution
Updated the `DELETE` endpoint in `EnquiryController.cs` to:
- Check if enquiry has been converted to a member (prevents deletion)
- Delete related history records first
- Then delete the enquiry

### Code Changes
```csharp
// DELETE: api/Enquiry/5
[HttpDelete("{id}")]
public async Task<IActionResult> DeleteEnquiry(int id)
{
    // Check if enquiry has been converted to member
    var hasMembership = await _context.MembersMemberships.AnyAsync(m => m.EnquiryId == id);
    if (hasMembership)
    {
        return BadRequest(new { message = "Cannot delete enquiry that has been converted to member." });
    }

    // Delete related history records first
    var historyRecords = await _context.EnquiryHistories.Where(h => h.EnquiryId == id).ToListAsync();
    _context.EnquiryHistories.RemoveRange(historyRecords);

    // Create final history record before deletion
    await CreateEnquiryHistory(enquiry, EnquiryAction.Deleted);

    _context.Enquiries.Remove(enquiry);
    await _context.SaveChangesAsync();

    return NoContent();
}
```

### Testing
- Delete enquiry that hasn't been converted: ✅ Works
- Try to delete converted enquiry: ✅ Shows error message
- Foreign key constraints: ✅ Handled properly

---

## 2. ✅ Role Enum for User Management

### Problem
Admins need predefined roles when creating users, not free text.

### Solution
Created a `UserRole` enum with system roles:
- **Admin** - Full system access
- **Trainer** - Trainer specific features
- **Receptionist** - Front desk operations
- **Member** - Regular gym member

### Files Created
- `GymManagmentSystem/Models/Enums/UserRole.cs`

```csharp
namespace GymManagmentSystem.Models.Enums
{
    public enum UserRole
    {
        Admin,
        Trainer,
        Receptionist,
        Member
    }
}
```

### API Endpoint Added
```
GET /api/User/AvailableRoles
```

Returns: `["Admin", "Trainer", "Receptionist", "Member"]`

### Frontend Integration
- User creation form now has a dropdown with available roles
- Roles are fetched from the backend API
- Admin selects role when creating new user

---

## 3. ✅ Excel Export for Enquiries

### Problem
Need ability to download all enquiries data in Excel format for reporting.

### Solution
- Added `EPPlus` NuGet package (v7.5.1) for Excel generation
- Created export endpoint that generates Excel file with all enquiry data
- Added download button in frontend

### Backend Implementation

**Package Added:**
```xml
<PackageReference Include="EPPlus" Version="7.5.1" />
```

**API Endpoint:**
```
GET /api/Enquiry/ExportToExcel
```

**Response:** Excel file (.xlsx) with columns:
- ID
- First Name
- Last Name
- Email
- Phone
- WhatsApp
- Address
- City
- Gender
- Date of Birth
- Occupation
- Created By
- Created At

**Features:**
- Professional styling with header row (bold, light blue background)
- Auto-fit columns
- Timestamped filename: `Enquiries_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.xlsx`
- Downloads immediately when requested

### Frontend Implementation

**UI Changes:**
- Added "Export to Excel" button in Enquiries header
- Uses `Download` icon from lucide-react
- Button styled with `btn-success` (green)

**Download Process:**
1. User clicks "Export to Excel" button
2. Frontend makes API call to `/api/Enquiry/ExportToExcel`
3. Receives blob response
4. Creates download link and triggers download
5. File saves to user's Downloads folder

---

## 4. ✅ Frontend Updates

### Enquiries Component (`gym-management-ui/src/components/enquiries/Enquiries.tsx`)

**New Features:**
- Export to Excel button
- Better error handling for delete operations
- Shows appropriate error messages

**Code:**
```typescript
const handleExportToExcel = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await enquiryAPI.exportToExcel();
    const url = window.URL.createObjectURL(new Blob([response]));
    const link = document.createElement('a');
    link.href = url;
    link.setAttribute('download', `Enquiries_${new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]}.xlsx`);
    document.body.appendChild(link);
    link.click();
    link.remove();
    window.URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error exporting to Excel:', error);
    alert('Failed to export enquiries to Excel');
  }
};
```

### Users Component (`gym-management-ui/src/components/users/Users.tsx`)

**New Features:**
- Fully functional user creation modal

// Enquiry API
exportToExcel: async (): Promise<Blob> => {
  const response = await api.get('/Enquiry/ExportToExcel', {
    responseType: 'blob'
  });
  return response.data;
}

// User API
export const userAPI = {
  getAll: async (): Promise<any[]> => { ... },
  getAvailableRoles: async (): Promise<string[]> => { ... },
  register: async (data: any): Promise<any> => { ... },
  delete: async (id: string): Promise<void> => { ... }
};
```

---

## Dependencies Added

### Backend
- **EPPlus** v7.5.1 - For Excel file generation

### Frontend
No new dependencies (all features use existing packages)

---

## Known Issues & Notes

1. **EPPlus License:** Currently set to `NonCommercial`. If using commercially, you need to purchase a license.

2. **Excel File Size:** Large number of enquiries may result in large Excel files. Consider pagination for very large datasets.

3. **User Role Validation:** Role validation is done on frontend. Backend accepts any role string. Consider adding server-side validation.

4. **Delete Cascade:** When deleting enquiry, history is also deleted. This is by design but consider keeping history for audit purposes.

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Export Filters:** Allow filtering enquiries before export (by date, city, etc.)
2. **Multiple File Formats:** Add PDF, CSV export options
3. **Bulk Operations:** Delete/export multiple enquiries at once
4. **Role Permissions:** Implement granular permissions per role
5. **Audit Trail:** Keep deletion history in separate audit table

---

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check console logs in browser (F12)
2. Check backend terminal for errors
3. Verify database connection
4. Ensure all packages are restored (`dotnet restore`, `npm install`)
